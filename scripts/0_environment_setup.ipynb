    "# Environment Setup Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook installs the Python dependencies required for the SEPIO project. It is recommended to work inside an isolated environment (virtualenv or conda) rather than the system interpreter to avoid version conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommended (PowerShell) before opening the notebook:\n",
    "```\n",
    "python -m venv .venv\n",
    ".\\.venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1\n",
    "python -m pip install --upgrade pip\n",
    "```\n",
    "(Use `conda create -n sepio python=3.11` if you prefer Conda.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Package Groups\n",
    "- Core scientific stack: numerical computing, ML, plotting.\n",
    "- Sensors & signal: domain-specific sensor helpers.\n",
    "- File/path utilities: robust natural sorting.\n",
    "- 3D & GUI: interactive visualization and optional UI toolkits.\n",
    "- Vendor / simulation: ANSYS AEDT automation.\n",
    "- Optional / commented: less frequently needed or platform-provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes\n",
    "- `open3d-python` is deprecated; use `open3d` only.\n",
    "- `tkinter` ships with most standard Windows Python installs; install only if missing.\n",
    "- Use `%pip` magic inside notebooks for better environment synchronization vs raw `!pip`.\n",
    "- Pin versions for reproducibility in production (e.g., `numpy==1.26.*`).\n"
