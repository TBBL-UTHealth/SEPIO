# SEPIO
Code repo for a publication on SEPIO (Sparse electrode placement for optimized input-output)

## Features

- **Lead Field Handling**: Export lead fields from Ansys EDT, import and assess in Python.
- **Electrode Placement Optimization**: Algorithms for optimizing electrode placement to maximize signal quality and information capacity.
- **Multi-Device Support**: Tools for handling multiple device types, including DISC, SEEG, and ECoG.
- **Visualization**: 2D and 3D plotting utilities for visualizing electrode configurations and device placements.
- **Simulation**: Monte Carlo simulations for evaluating information capacity and signal-to-noise ratios (SNR).
- **Lead Field Processing**: Utilities for importing, transforming, and analyzing lead field data.

## Scripts
Script names are prefixed with their order of use for generating data found in the publication and explained in the diagram below.
